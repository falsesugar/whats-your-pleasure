              <i>What's Your Pleasure?</i> is an <a href="https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">ITP, NYU</a> thesis project by <a href="https://tina.pizza/">Tina Rungsawang</a>. </p>
              <p class="desc-text">  
              Women's sexuality has historically been repressed for centuries, due to the fact that history has been predominantly written by men. The patriarchal structure perceives women as soft, weak, and passive. The ownership of women's bodies have always been taken away from us, making us feel ashamed of our innate emotions and desires, and depriving us of our pleasure systems.</p> 
               <p class="desc-text">That repression of female sexuality is an existing systemic issue in all cultures, even in the liberated West. Much of our sexuality is learned and absorbed throughout our lifetime. We learn from mass culture how to kiss and touch, what's acceptable and what's taboo. Unfortunately, realistic and helpful models of female sexuality are hard to come by. 
                By providing the necessities for women to understand their bodies and pleasures better, the What's Your Pleasure? experience aims to instill more feminine assertion, confidence and ownership in their sexual activities.</p>
                <p class="desc-text">The physical toolkit comes with a variety of stimulating outputs and inputs for the user to create a tactile pleasure device that is suits their desires.
