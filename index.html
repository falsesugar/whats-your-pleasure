          Sexuality and technology are two realms in which women have been told
          were not made for them; that we don't belong in and cannot own. What's
          Your Pleasure? is a set of tools and instructions that encourages
          women to explore and curate their own pleasure system through the
          building of a unique technological sensual object.

          Our physical toolkit comes with a variety of stimulating outputs and
          inputs for the user to easily create a tactile gadget that is
          distinctively theirs. This website offers further information and a
          community for women to learn and share experiences relating to sex and
          pleasure. Through the reinforcement of technological capabilities, our
          goal is to provide to women a sense of empowerment and ownership of
          their individual sexuality and pleasure.
